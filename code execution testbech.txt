code execution for testbench:

A port map is used to import project.vhd.
Signals are assigned with signals from project.vhd

Then, these signals are assigned values. We force the software to wait for 20ns for results.
Repeat this for a number of scenarios to test the system.

At the end, we use a variable error status to check if there is a problem.
Since registers are used, there exits a very large amount of cases to consider (previous occupancy, new x, new y,etc.).
Therefore, we check if reset works and if max amount people enter or leave the room.
If expected result is not met, then there is an error.
